## 🔭 System Projection on Genomes

The `write_systems` command enables the projection of systems, previously detected at the pangenome level
(see [`systems` command](detection.md)), onto individual genomes. Projection relies on system detection results and
the genomic context of gene families within organisms.

### 🧪 Projection Workflow

The projection process has been optimized and proceeds as follows:

#### 1. 📂 Load Detected Systems and Metadata

- Detected systems from the .h5 pangenome file are loaded
- Required metadata and gene families are retrieved
- System-to-family mappings are established for efficient processing

#### 2. 🧱 Build Gene Context Components

For each organism and functional unit, the workflow uses a **component-based approach** instead of graph
construction:

1. **Identify Model Genes**: Extract genes belonging to system families in each organism
2. **Group by Contig**: Organize genes by their chromosomal/plasmid location
3. **Extract Windows**: Use `extract_contig_window()` to identify genomic regions containing system genes within the
   specified window size
4. **Create Components**: Each window becomes a component containing all genes (model + context) within that region

This approach directly identifies co-localized gene clusters.

#### 3. 🧠 Project System Units

Each system unit is evaluated in organisms through the following steps:

##### Unit Requirements Validation

- **Family Requirements**: Check if required families from the model are present
- **Completeness Calculation**: Determine what fraction of model families are found
- **Context Analysis**: Identify additional families within the same genomic context

##### System State Classification

Components are classified into three genomic organization states:

- **strict**: All model families are found within the same connected component/window
- **split**: Model families are present but spread across multiple disconnected components
- **extended**: All model families are in the same context with additional intervening families

##### Gene Categorization

Each projected gene is categorized as:

- **model**: Gene belongs to a family defined in the system model
- **context**: Gene is co-localized with model genes but not part of the system definition
- **filtered**: Gene was excluded during filtering steps

#### 4. 🔄 Aggregate and Filter Projections

The projection includes advanced filtering options:

##### Standard Projection

- Collects all valid projections for each organism
- Calculates completeness metrics
- Maintains full system context information

##### One-Unit-Per-Family Filtering

New optimization that handles overlapping system units:

- **Overlap Resolution**: When multiple units contain the same gene family, keeps only the unit with highest
  completeness
- **Overlapping Units Tracking**: Records information about filtered units in `overlapping_units` column
- **System Elimination Options**:
    - `eliminate_filtered_systems`: Remove entire systems if any model families were filtered
    - `eliminate_empty_systems`: Remove systems with no remaining model families

#### 5. 📝 Write Output

Projection results are written as TSV files with improved organization and metadata.

- Multiple values in cells are comma-separated
- Unique values are maintained where appropriate
