## üî≠ System Projection on Genomes

The `write_systems` command enables the projection of systems, previously detected at the pangenome level 
(see [`systems` command](./detection.md), onto individual genomes. 
Projection relies on system detection results and the genomic context of gene families within organisms.

### üß™ Projection Workflow
The projection process proceeds as follows:

1. üìÇ Load Detected Systems and Metadata

    Detected systems from the .h5 pangenome file are loaded, along with required metadata and gene families.

2. üß± Build systems organisms contexts graphs

    For each organism and functional unit:
    1. Build a gene context graph using adjacency in the genome (based on window size and strand orientation). 
    2. Nodes represent genes; edges represent local gene neighborhood.

3. üß† Project System Units

    Each system unit is evaluated in organisms:
    1. Genes belonging to system families are checked for co-localization and graph connectivity. 
    2. Subsystems are classified as:
       - strict: All families in the model are connected by a maximum distance equal to the *transitivity* parameter. 
       - extended: All model families are found in the same context but additional families between them. 
       - split: All model families are found in the organisms but in different connected components. 
          Such fragmentation can occur in a subset of genomes due to rearrangements, insertion events (e.g., insertion sequences), or assembly breaks.

4. üîÑ Aggregate Projections

    Results are collected at:
   - Organism-level: Individual gene projections with system metadata.
   - Pangenome-level: Summarized presence/absence and completeness across all organisms.

5. üìù Write Output (more detail in [output section](#-output-files))

    Projection results are written as TSV files:
    - **systems.tsv**: One summary file for the pangenome
    - **[organism_name].tsv**: One detailed file per organism.

### üöÄ Command Line Usage

Projection is triggered via:

```shell
panorama write_systems \
--pangenomes pangenomes.tsv \
--models models.tsv \
--sources defense_finder \
--projection \
--threads 8
```

To project systems only to a specific set of organisms:

```shell
--organisms organism_A organism_B
```

#### üìÑ Output Files

Output is written inside the specified `--output` directory. 
For each pangenome, a directory based on the pangenome name is created to save the results.

##### 1. Pangenome systems summary

First a TSV file summarizing all systems detected at the pangenome level is written.

üß† Notes
Systems are projected independently per unit; partial matches are retained and classified.

Context-aware graph-building ensures precision in localizing system units.

Projection supports RGPs, spots, and modules if enabled via --association.
