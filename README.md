# PANORAMA: Pangenomics toolbox for comparison and analyses of prokaryotic pangenomes

PANORAMA is a software suite used to analyse and compare partitioned pangenomes graph provided. It benefits from 
methods for the reconstruction and analysis of pangenome graphs, thanks to the [PPanGGOLiN](https://github.com/labgem/PPanGGOLiN) software suite. It is designed to perform pangenome comparison at high-throughtup level.
