# Conserved Spots Comparison Across Pangenomes

The compare_spots command identifies and analyzes conserved genomic spots across multiple pangenomes by comparing their
gene family composition and genomic organization patterns.
This analysis builds upon previously
[computed spots](https://ppanggolin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/RGP/rgpAnalyses.html#spot-prediction) from individual
pangenomes and uses **Gene Family Relatedness Relationship (GFRR) metrics** to identify regions that are conserved
across different bacterial populations. Optionally, it can integrate systems detection results to analyze biological
systems within conserved regions.

## Conserved Spots Detection Workflow

The conserved spots comparison process runs as follows:

1. Load and Validate Pangenomes
    - Multiple pangenomes are loaded from .h5 files based on a .tsv file.
    - Each pangenome is validated to ensure that spots and RGPs have been computed.
2. Create Spots Graph
    - All spots from all pangenomes are represented as nodes in a unified NetworkX graph.
    - Each spot is characterized by its bordering gene families.
3. Compute GFRR-based Edges
    - For each pair of spots from different pangenomes:
        - Gene families at spot borders are extracted and compared.
        - GFRR metrics (min_gfrr and max_gfrr) are computed based on shared families.
    - Edges are added between spots that exceed both GFRR cutoff thresholds.
4. Cluster Conserved Spots
    - Graph clustering algorithms identify groups of similar spots that represent conserved genomic regions across
      pangenomes based on the selected GFRR metric.
5. Systems Integration (Optional)
    - When [enabled](detection.md), systems analysis creates linkage graphs showing relationships between biological
      systems through their association with conserved spots.

6. Write Results to Files
    - Conserved spots are saved as detailed TSV files and optional graph formats (GEXF, GraphML) for visualization.

```{note}
PANORAMA can perform the clustering step first thing, but it's also possible to use pre-computed clustering results with
the `--cluster` argument.
If you use let PANORAMA perform the clustering, you can look at the [Clustering](clustering.md#clustering) section for more
details about options.

### GFRR Metrics

| Metric   | Formula                                               | Description                                                        |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| min_gfrr | shared_families / min(families_spot1, families_spot2) | Conservative metric requiring high overlap relative to smaller set |
| max_gfrr | shared_families / max(families_spot1, families_spot2) | Liberal metric allowing partial overlap relative to larger set     |

### Sensitivity Control

The dual cutoff system provides fine-grained control over conservation stringency:

| Cutoff Level | min_gfrr | max_gfrr | Behavior                              |
|--------------|----------|----------|---------------------------------------|
| Strict       | 0.8      | 0.8      | High-confidence conserved spots only  |
| Moderate     | 0.6      | 0.7      | Balanced sensitivity and specificity  |
| Permissive   | 0.4      | 0.5      | Detects distant conservation patterns |

PANORAMA generates multiple outputs: detailed spot information files, summary tables, and optional graph visualizations.
