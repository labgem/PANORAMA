## Suggesting a New Feature üí°

Have an idea to improve PANORAMA? We'd love to hear it!

### Before Suggesting

1. **Check existing features** - Make sure the feature doesn't already exist
2. **Search the issues** - Someone might have already suggested something similar
3. **Think about the use case** - How would this feature be useful to you and others?

### Creating a Feature Request

Go to the [PANORAMA issue tracker](https://github.com/labgem/PANORAMA/issues/new) and use this template:

A clear description of the feature you'd like to see.

## Use Case
Describe the problem this feature would solve or the workflow it would improve.

**Example scenario:**
"When I'm analyzing large pangenomes with >10k genomes, I need to..."

## Proposed Solution
How do you envision this feature working?

**Example:**
`panorama new_command --option value`

## Alternatives Considered
Have you thought of any alternative solutions or workarounds?

## Tips for Good Reports üìã

### Do:
- Be specific and detailed
- Include examples and use cases
- Provide complete error messages
- Be respectful and constructive
- Follow up if we ask questions

### Don't:
- Report multiple unrelated issues in one report
- Demand immediate fixes or features
- Include sensitive or private data
- Duplicate existing issues

## Example Issues üìö

### Good Bug Report Example

```markdown
## Bug Description
The `panorama systems` command crashes with a KeyError when processing 
pangenomes that have gene families without functional annotations.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a pangenome without running annotation first
2. Run: `panorama systems --pangenomes test.h5 --models defense_models.yml`
3. Error occurs during system detection

## Expected Behavior
Should either skip unannotated families or show a helpful error message 
suggesting to run annotation first.

## Actual Behavior
    ```shell
    KeyError: 'annotation'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "panorama/systems/detection.py", line 145, in detect_systems
        annotation = family.metadata['annotation']
    KeyError: 'annotation'
    ```

## Environment
- PANORAMA version: 1.2.3
- Python version: 3.10.8
- Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04
- Installation: pip

## Input Data
- 500 genomes
- 12,000 gene families
- No annotation step performed

## Possible Solution
Check if annotation metadata exists before accessing it, or add a validation 
step that ensures annotation has been run before system detection.
```

### Good Feature Request Example

```markdown
## Feature Description
Add support for exporting system detection results in JSON format.

## Use Case
I'm integrating PANORAMA into an automated pipeline that processes results 
with Python scripts. Currently, I have to parse TSV files which is error-prone.
JSON would allow direct loading into Python dictionaries and easier integration 
with web APIs.

## Proposed Solution
Add a `--format` option to `panorama write_systems`:

    ```bash
    panorama write_systems --pangenomes data.h5 --output results/ --format json
    ```

Output structure:
    ```json
    {
      "systems": [
        {
          "id": "system_001",
          "model": "CRISPR-Cas",
          "organisms": ["org1", "org2"],
          "completeness": 0.95,
          "gene_families": [...]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

## Alternatives Considered
- Parsing TSV files (current workaround, but fragile)
- Converting TSV to JSON with external tools (extra step)

## Additional Context
Many bioinformatics tools now offer JSON output (e.g., Prokka, eggNOG-mapper).
This would align PANORAMA with modern pipeline practices.

## Would you be willing to contribute?
- [x] Yes, with guidance - I could implement this with some pointers on where 
  to add the JSON export logic.
```
