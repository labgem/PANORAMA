# Development Methods and Best Practices ðŸ’»

Welcome to the PANORAMA development guide! This document covers the coding standards, tools, and practices we follow to
keep the codebase clean, maintainable, and performant. Whether you're fixing a small bug or building a major feature,
these guidelines will help you write code that fits right in.

```{note}
**First time working on PANORAMA?** Don't worry about memorizing everything here. 
Start coding, and refer back as needed. 
The tools we use will catch most issues automatically, and code review will help with the rest. 
```

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Install Development Tools

We've bundled all the development tools you need in the `pyproject.toml`:

```shell
# From the PANORAMA root directory
pip install -e .[dev]  # -e for editable mode (recommended)
```

This installs:

- **[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/)** - Code formatter
- **VizTracer** - Performance profiling
- **Vitables** - Interface to open HDF5 files
- And more!

Now you're ready to develop!

## Code Style and Formatting
```{tip}
Most IDE integrates plugins for code formatting and linting.
Look at your IDE's documentation for more information.
```

### PEP 8: Python's Style Guide

We follow as much as possible [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/),
Python's official style guide. It covers things like:

- Indentation (4 spaces, not tabs)
- Line length (max 79 characters for code, 72 for comments)
- Naming conventions (snake_case for functions, CamelCase for classes)
- Import organization
- Whitespace usage

```{hint}
**The good news?** You don't need to memorize this! Our tools handle most of it automatically.
```


### Black: The Uncompromising Code Formatter

We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) to format all Python code. Black makes formatting decisions for you, so
you can focus on logic instead of style debates.

**Format your code before committing:**

```shell
# Format all Python files in the project
black panorama/ tests/

# Check what would change without modifying files
black --check panorama/ tests/

# Format a specific file
black panorama/systems/system.py
```

Black is opinionated, which is actually great - no more discussions about where to put line breaks!

```{hint}
Set up your editor to run Black on save:
- **VSCode**: Install the Python extension, enable format on save
- **PyCharm**: Use the Black plugin
- **Vim**: Use the black.vim plugin
```

### Linting with flake8

While Black handles formatting, [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) catches potential bugs and style issues:

```shell
# Check the entire project
flake8 panorama/ tests/

# Check specific files
flake8 panorama/systems/system.py
```

Fix the issues flake8 reports before pushing. Most are quick fixes!

## Writing Clean, Maintainable Code

### Naming Conventions

We follow Python's naming conventions [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions)

### Docstrings: Document Your Code

We choose to use [Google style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings) 
for our code. 

Every public function, class, and module should have a docstring.

### Type Hints

Use type hints to make your code more readable and catch bugs early:

```python
from typing import List, Optional, Set, Dict


def merge_gene_families(
        families: List[GeneFamily],
        threshold: float = 0.95
) -> Set[GeneFamily]:
    """Merge similar gene families above the threshold."""
    pass
```

Type hints are especially helpful for:

- Complex function signatures
- When None is a valid return value
- Collections (List, Dict, Set)
- When working with multiple types

### Keep Functions Small

Each function should do one thing well.

## Error Handling and Validation

We try to anticipate and handle errors as early as possible:
- think about what could go wrong
- Choose the Right Exception Type
- Validate Input Early
- Log Important Events - use Python's logging module for informational messages

## Performance and Optimization

### Profile Before Optimizing

```{important}
**"Premature optimization is the root of all evil"** - Donald Knuth
```

Don't guess where your code is slow - measure it! 
We use [VizTracer](https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer) for performance profiling.
But you're free to use any tool you like.



### When to Optimize

Optimize when:

- Profiling shows a clear bottleneck
- Users report performance issues
- You're working with very large datasets

Don't optimize when:

- Code is already fast enough
- It would make code much harder to read
- The slow part is I/O bound (disk/network)

Remember: **Readable code > Clever code**

## Code Organization

### Module Structure

Organize code logically:

```
panorama/
â”œâ”€â”€ systems/           # System detection and analysis
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ system.py     # Core System classes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models.py     # Model definitions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ detection.py  # Detection algorithms
â”œâ”€â”€ annotation/        # Functional annotation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ annotate.py
â””â”€â”€ utility/            # Shared utilities
    â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
    â””â”€â”€ translate       # Module for translating models from set of sources
        â””â”€â”€macsymodel_translator.py
        â””â”€â”€padloc_translator.py
```

### Ask for Help

Development is a collaborative process! When you're stuck:

1. Check existing code for similar patterns
2. Search the issue tracker
3. Ask in discussions or chat
4. Tag a maintainer in your PR
5. Pair program with a colleague
