# Testing Guidelines for PANORAMA üß™

Welcome to the PANORAMA testing guide! Whether you're adding your first test or refactoring an entire test suite, this
document will help you write tests that are reliable, maintainable, and actually useful. Good tests make everyone's life
easier - including yours!

```{note}
**New to testing or pytest?** No worries! We'll walk you through everything. 
Testing might seem daunting at first, but once you get the hang of it, you'll wonder how you ever coded without it.
 And if you get stuck, just ask - we're here to help!
```

## What We're Testing üî≠

PANORAMA uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) as its testing framework. We organize our tests into two main
categories:

- **Unit tests** - Test individual functions, methods, and classes in isolation.
- **Functional tests** - Test complete workflows and command-line interfaces.

Both types are important! Unit tests catch bugs early and make debugging easier. Functional tests ensure that real-world
usage actually works.

## General Testing Philosophy üìù

### Framework and Structure

Here's how we organize tests in PANORAMA:

- **Use pytest exclusively** - It's powerful, flexible, and widely used
- **Prefer class-based organization** - Groups related tests together nicely
- **Write descriptive test names** - `test_merge_handles_empty_systems` beats `test_merge_1`
- **Use fixtures liberally** - Don't repeat yourself when setting up test data
- **Parametrize similar tests** - Test multiple cases without copy-pasting code

### Basic Test Structure

Here's what a well-organized test class looks like:

```python
class TestSystemMerging:
    """Test the System.merge() functionality."""

    @pytest.fixture
    def empty_system(self):
        """Create an empty system for testing."""
        return System(model=test_model, source="test")

    def test_merge_empty_systems(self, empty_system):
        """Merging two empty systems should work without errors."""
        other_system = System(model=test_model, source="test")
        empty_system.merge(other_system)
        assert len(empty_system) == 0

    @pytest.mark.parametrize("num_units", [1, 5, 10])
    def test_merge_multiple_units(self, empty_system, num_units):
        """Test merging systems with varying numbers of units."""
        # Test implementation
        pass
```

Clean, organized, and easy to understand!

## Setting Up Your Test Environment üõ†Ô∏è

### Install Test Dependencies

First, install the testing tools:

```shell
# From the PANORAMA root directory
pip install -e .[test]  # -e for editable mode (recommended)
```

This installs pytest, coverage tools, and everything else you need.

### Get the Test Data

We keep test data in a separate repository to keep the main repo lightweight:

```shell
# Clone the test data repository
git clone https://github.com/labgem/PANORAMA_test

# Set the environment variable (or use --test-data-path flag)
export PANORAMA_TEST_DATA_PATH=PANORAMA_test/
```

Now you're ready to run tests!

## Running Tests ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

### Local Testing

Here are the most common commands you'll use:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage (shows which code is tested)
pytest --cov=panorama

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_systems.py

# Run specific test class
pytest tests/test_systems.py::TestSystemUnit

# Run specific test method
pytest tests/test_systems.py::TestSystemUnit::test_init_basic

# Run only tests marked as requiring test data
pytest -m "requires_test_data"

# Run tests in parallel (faster!)
pytest -n auto

# Verbose output (helpful for debugging)
pytest -v

# Show print statements (useful for debugging)
pytest -s
```

**If you haven't set the environment variable:**

```bash
pytest --test-data-path=/path/to/PANORAMA_test
```

## Test Quality and Coverage üìà

### Coverage Goals

We aim for high coverage, but smart coverage:

- **Target >90% line coverage** - This catches most bugs
- **Don't chase 100%** - Diminishing returns and sometimes impossible
- **Focus on critical paths** - Test important code thoroughly
- **Use coverage to find gaps** - Not as a grade to optimize

```bash
# Generate coverage report
pytest --cov=panorama --cov-report=html

# Open htmlcov/index.html in your browser to see details
```

Red lines in the coverage report? Those might need tests!

### What Makes Tests High Quality?

Good tests are:

- **Fast** - Unit tests run in milliseconds, functional tests in seconds
- **Reliable** - Same result every time, no flaky tests
- **Independent** - Can run in any order
- **Readable** - Someone else can understand what's being tested
- **Maintainable** - Easy to update when code changes

If a test is slow, flaky, or confusing, it needs improvement!

## Working with CI

### What the CI Does

When you push code, GitHub Actions automatically:

1. Downloads the test data from the separate repository
2. Installs all dependencies
3. Runs the full test suite with coverage
4. Reports results back to your pull request

The workflow looks like this:

```bash
# Download test data
git clone https://github.com/labgem/PANORAMA_test test_data

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=panorama --test-data-path=test_data
```

If tests fail in CI but pass locally, it might be an environment issue. Don't hesitate to ask for help debugging!

### How Tests Integrate with Development

Here's the typical flow:

1. You write code and tests locally
2. Run tests locally (`pytest`)
3. Push to your branch
4. GitHub Actions runs the full test suite
5. Tests pass ‚Üí ready for review!
6. Tests fail ‚Üí fix and push again

```{tip}
Run tests locally before pushing. It's much faster than waiting for CI!
```

### Understanding CI Failures

If tests fail in CI:

- Check the logs carefully
- Try to reproduce locally
- Could be a test data issue
- Could be an environment difference
- Ask for help if stuck!

## Getting Help with Testing üÜò

Stuck on something? Here's what to do:

1. **Check the pytest documentation** - [docs.pytest.org](https://docs.pytest.org/)
2. **Look at existing tests** - Find similar tests in the codebase
3. **Ask in discussions** - Other developers have probably hit the same issue
4. **Open a draft PR** - Get feedback on your tests
5. **Tag a maintainer** - We're happy to help!

**Remember:** Writing good tests is a skill that takes practice. Your first tests might not be perfect, and that's
completely fine. We're here to help you improve!

## For New Contributors üåç

We genuinely appreciate when contributors include tests with their code! Here's what you should know:

**Test expectations for PRs:**

- New features should include tests
- Bug fixes should include a regression test
- Don't worry about perfect coverage on your first try
- We'll help you improve tests during review

**Not sure how to test something?**

- Ask! Testing advice is part of code review
- Check similar existing tests for patterns
- Start simple - basic tests are better than no tests
- We can help you expand test coverage

**Common questions:**

- *"Do I need to test this tiny change?"* - If it's code, yes! Even simple tests catch bugs.
- *"How much should I test?"* - Test happy paths, error cases, and edge cases.
- *"My test is complicated, is that OK?"* - Maybe! We can help simplify it.

Testing makes PANORAMA better for everyone. Thanks for taking the time to test your code! üéâ
